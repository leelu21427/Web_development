            <p style="color:black">A beach is a landform alongside a body of water which consists of loose particles. The particles composing a beach are typically made from rock, such as sand, gravel, shingle, pebbles, etc., or biological sources, such as mollusc shells or coralline algae. Sediments settle in different densities and structures, depending on the local wave action and weather, creating different textures, colors and gradients or layers of material.</p><br>

                <center><p >Though some beaches form on inland freshwater locations such as 
                lakes and rivers, most beaches are in coastal areas where wave or
            current action deposits and reworks sediments. Erosion and changing of beach 
            geologies happens through natural processes, like wave action and extreme 
            weather events. Where wind conditions are correct, beaches can be backed by 
            coastal dunes which offer protection and regeneration for the beach. However, 
            these natural forces have become more extreme due to climate change, permanently 
            altering beaches at very rapid rates. Some estimates describe as much as 50 percent 
            of the earth's sandy beaches disappearing by 2100 due to climate-change driven 
            sea level rise.</p></center>

            <p>Human forces have significantly changed beaches globally: direct impacts include bad construction practices on dunes and coastlines, while indirect human impacts include water pollution, plastic pollution and coastal erosion from sea level rise and climate change. Some coastal management practices are designed to preserve or restore natural beach processes, while some beaches are actively restored through practices like beach nourishment.</p><br>

                    <center><p>Sandy beaches are loose deposits of sand, including possibly some gravel or shells, that cover the shoreline in many places. They make up a large portion (about 30%) of the world’s ice-free coastlines. Beaches serve as buffer zones or shock absorbers that protect the coastline, sea cliffs or dunes from direct wave attack. It is an extremely dynamic environment where sand, water and air flow permanently interact. Beaches are also important coastal recreational areas and tourist destinations. Fine-grained sand beaches tend to be gently sloping and quite flat.</p></center>

                        <center><p> Rocky beaches occur where coastal cliffs erode and crumble into large rock deposits along the the shoreline, blocking the build up of smaller, sandy sediment. Rocky beaches are areas of rich intertidal biodiversity. Due to their accessibility, they have been studied perhaps more than any other habitat in the field of marine ecology. A process known as zonation occurs along rocky shores where very distinct habitat zones emerge as a result of the various stages of tidal exposure along the shore. Across these zones, species include plankton, seaweed and algae, barnacles, limpets and sea anemones, as well as a wide array of organic matter brought in with the tides.</p></center>

                <center><p>If sandy and rocky weren’t enough for you, muddy beaches, or mudflats, offer another unique beach experience. Mudflats are formed when tides and rivers deposit mud, estuarine silts, and clay along the shoreline. The majority of mud is found within the intertidal zone. This means they are only exposed during low tide, making the mud quite wet and soft. In northern European countries, such as Netherlands and Germany, mudflat hiking is a popular activity where hikers capitalize on low tides to hike along the mud flats. Many of the worlds mudflats exist in this region, however they are also found in Asia and North America.</p></center>

                    <center><p>Freshwater Beach is a beach located in Freshwater, New South Wales, a suburb of Sydney, Australia. Freshwater Beach is the first beach north of Manly, New South Wales, on the Peninsula. The beach is flanked by a headland at each end and can produce excellent surf. There is a large rock pool at the northern end. The beach is patrolled by lifeguards and has its own surf lifesaving club. Freshwater Beach is one of the most popular of Sydney’s 21 Northern Beaches and is visited by around 3,000 people on weekends and public holidays during the summer months.</p></center>

                    <center>The Maldives (/ˈmɔːldiːvz/, US: /ˈmɔːldaɪvz/; Dhivehi: ދިވެހިރާއްޖެ, romanized: Dhivehi Raajje, Dhivehi pronunciation: [d̪iʋehi ɾaːd͡ʒːe]), officially the Republic of Maldives (ދިވެހިރާއްޖޭގެ ޖުމްހޫރިއްޔާ, Dhivehi Raajjeyge Jumhooriyyaa, Dhivehi pronunciation: [d̪iʋehi ɾaːd͡ʒːeːge d͡ʒumhuːɾijjaː]), is an archipelagic state in South Asia, situated in the Indian Ocean. It lies southwest of Sri Lanka and India, about 750 kilometres (470 miles; 400 nautical miles) from the Asian continent's mainland. The Maldives' chain of 26 atolls stretches across the equator from Ihavandhippolhu Atoll in the north to Addu Atoll in the south.</center>

                        <center><p>In the 12th century Islam reached the Maldivian Archipelago, which was consolidated as a sultanate, developing strong commercial and cultural ties with Asia and Africa. From the mid-16th century, the region came under the increasing influence of European colonial powers, with the Maldives becoming a British protectorate in 1887. Independence from the United Kingdom came in 1965, and a presidential republic was established in 1968 with an elected People's Majlis. The ensuing decades have seen political instability, efforts at democratic reform, and environmental challenges posed by climate change and rising sea levels.
                            The Maldives became a founding member of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). It is also a member of the United Nations, the Commonwealth of Nations, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, and the Non-Aligned Movement. The World Bank classifies the Maldives as having an upper-middle income economy.Fishing has historically been the dominant economic activity, and remains the largest sector by far, followed by the rapidly growing tourism industry. The Maldives rates "high" on the Human Development Index,[19] with per capita income significantly higher than other SAARC nations.</p></center>

                            The Maldives was a member of the Commonwealth of Nations from July 1982 until withdrawing from the organisation in October 2016 in protest of allegations by other nations of its human rights abuses and failing democracy. The Maldives rejoined the Commonwealth on 1 February 2020 after showing evidence of functioning democratic processes and popular support.</p></center>
